# The Broom Stack
The Broom Stack is software to manage a curling club, including a back end and web interface.

## Roadmap
I will be working on this in my spare time, with the goal of having v1.0 available by the end of 2016. Until things get up and running, I will not be accepting pull requests. If you are intersted in contributing, please contact me.

## Purpose
There are a number of software packages available to manage a curling club. I have not found one that truly meets the needs of my curling club, so I have set out to create one from scratch. The software will be provided for free in hopes that other clubs find it useful.

## Stack
NodeJS, React, TypeScript. Other technologies to be determined.
